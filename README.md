# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

My motivation was to summary my skills in HTML and CSS. This was created as edX bootcamp challenge at the end of week 1.

I have build this project to test my skills and what i have learn thru week.

Those are 5 points i had to deal with:

- Change Non-Semantic HTML elements to semantic.

- Sort HTML elements follow a logical structure.

- Add alt attributes to image and icon.

- Do a sequential order in heading of a page.

- Create descriptive title for website.

As this is my first serious HTML project I accept any criticisms and any approvals on this.
